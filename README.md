Using a movies dataset, we create a recommender system to output a movie that would correspond to certain metrics. 
In order to build the recommendation system, we used kNN to fit the measurements of movies into their nearest value. 
After inputing the metrics given by the assignment, we were able to give a recommendation for a movie based on the nearest metrics.
